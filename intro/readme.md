This project is the exercises I did as
part of reading through Learn Ruby the 
Hard Way by Zed A. Shaw.

This work was done as a homework assignment
for the [Davinci Coders](http://www.davincicoders.com/)
class that I'm taking, titled "Building
the Toolbelt of a Junior Ruby on Rails 
Developer" taught by [Jason Noble](http://jasonnoble.org).



What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?
1. Reading and writing.
2. Attention to detail.
3. Spotting the difference.

Q) Explain these three skills in your own words.
A) Reading and writing: This is the basics of programming. Being able to
identify different symbols and write different symbols familiarizes 
the coder to the language facilitating their learning as a programmer.

Q) Attention to detail: It is the small details that separates a good code 
A) and a bad code. All the little things that cause less bugs and easier
usage are what makes a code good. A code should not only work and do 
something, it should also be simple for the user and function efficiently.

Q) Spotting the difference: Being able to pick out small changes in a code 
A) saves time and  spent fixing problems. If a programmer can look at a code
and, by second nature, know whats wrong and how to fix it, they can easily 
write great efficient code.

Q) Why do you need to not copy and paste?
A) The act of writing out the code trains your mind whats write and whats wrong. You'll 
develop muscle memory and grow accustomed to correct code. Writing out code also works on
typing skills as will as helps you remember what your writing.
